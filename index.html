<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    The concepts of race and ethnicity are alive and moving in, both, public and academic discourse. 
    Race and ethnicity are often conceptualized as an American phenomenon in sociological literature. 
    While emerging scholarship postulate that concepts and dynamics of race and ethnicity are and have 
    been a global and transnational process. 
</p>

<p>
    This course aims to examine and analyze the social processes in which race and ethnicity are globally 
    produced and constructed as “difference.” This course will break open the homogenous and fixed 
    concepts of race and ethnicity, not to deny that there are biological and genetic variations within the 
    human species, rather to analyze the multiple meanings and consequences of these concepts for 
    people in the United States and all over the world. Race and ethnicity, as we will discover, is highly 
    negotiable and subjective, therefore socially constructed. Additionally, this course will address 
    racism, racial inequality and prejudice as core concepts in developing a sociological analysis of race 
    and ethnicity as a global and transnational phenomenon.
</p>

<h3>Grade Components</h3>

<h4 class="text-center"><em>Participation</em></h4>
<hr>
<p>
    The class needs YOU to be successful! We need to get to know one another so we can dive deep into 
    learning about the complicated topic of race and ethnicity. Weekly, you will be making your social 
    presence known on our online course while also getting to know your classmates. Whether that means 
    you fill out class “yearbook” or responding to a lecture question or commenting on a classmate’s post, 
    this portion of your grade will be about how you contribute positively to our online learning 
    community.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center"><em>Weekly Reading Quizzes</em></h4>
<hr>
<p>
    Readings for each class is moderate. Timed quizzes (1.5 hours) with multiple attempts will help you 
    identify key concepts and theories in our readings. Therefore each student will have to complete an 
    iLearn quiz that will open <strong>every Friday and close by Sunday at 11:59 PM</strong>, with exception for the 
    last reading quiz in Week 5 which will open on the date it is assigned for and will stay open until 
    Sunday at 11:59 PM. Questions for the final examination will be directly gleaned from the weekly 
    quiz. 
</p>

<h4 class="text-center"><em>Give and Go Assignments</em></h4>
<hr>

<p>
    You will have two short papers where you will submit a progress report on your final project and <strong>GIVE</strong> 
    feedback to your classmates. These short papers will propel you and your classmates to <strong>GO</strong> forward with their 
    final projects. The short papers will cover these topics respectively, (1) What “stock story” about a racial and 
    ethnic group, nationally and internationally, will you examine? (2) With regard to your previously stated racial 
    and ethnic stock story, what “concealed story” will you explore in your final project? These give and go 
    papers will be facilitated in a group.
</p>

<p>
    You will <strong>GIVE</strong> your ideas to your group via short papers due on <strong>June 18 and 25</strong>. All papers must be 
    a minimum of 500 words (2 pages) and a maximum of 750 (3 pages) words. All papers must respond 
    to the guidelines provided (see directions on the forum). You can upload your paper or cut and paste 
    your text into the text box of the forum. The tardiness of your paper will severely impact your 
    group mates, hence every day your paper is submitted late, you grade will be penalized one whole letter grade.
</p>

<p>
    For each short paper, your group mates of 3 (or 4), will provide feedback to your paper. Your 
    group mates will ask questions, provide constructive comments and affirmations and essentially, give 
    you a green light so you can GO forward with developing their papers towards your final project. To 
    get credit for this feedback, you will answer the 3-4 questions to provide feedback to someone’s short 
    paper. These questions can be found on the forum. <strong>Your feedback to your classmate will be due on 
    June 20 and 27 respectively.</strong> I will grade these assignments on Friday of every week.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center"><em>Final Examination</em></h4>
<hr>
<p>
    On <strong>July 11,</strong> you will have a timed (2 hours), open-book final examination that will assess your 
    understanding of concepts and debates that will be covered in readings, videos and lectures for the 
    class. The cumulative examination will have 50 multiple-choice questions that will be directly 
    gleaned from the weekly reading quizzes.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center"><em>Final Project</em></h4>
<hr>
<p>For your final project you can choose from the following:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">

            <p>This final paper will draw from your earlier papers where you identified a “stock story” about racial and ethnic power and privilege causing racial inequality and discrimination, and a “concealed story” that dispels that stock narrative. For this final paper, you will conduct a literature search for academic sources (peer-reviewed journal articles, single-author monographs, anthologies, etc.) and read 5-7 citations to get an understanding of the scholarship on your topic(s). Next, identify the dearth in the literature that you think is important to fill. Create an argument for why that gap in the literature exists and why it should be filled. Using at least 3 of the frameworks, authors and concepts covered in class and your literature search (through either documentaries, articles, or other written text we have covered), you will be required to critically analyze and unpack this topic. Your paper should be 8-10 pages long with 1” inch margins, 12 point font in Arial or Times New Roman and double spaced.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Did you clearly identify a topic(s) or concept(s) where stock stories about racial and ethnic power and privilege caused racial inequality? Did you discuss a concealed story that negotiated with the discrimination in the aforementioned stock story? (20 points)</li>
                <li>Did you conduct a literature review that included 5-7 citations and summarize the findings and arguments of the sources correctly? (20 points)</li>
                <li>Did you identify a gap in the literature, analyze that dearth and create an argument about why it should be filled? Did you critically engage the topic in your analysis in a logical manner? (30 points)</li>
                <li>Did you cite at least 3 of these authors and their work from our course to your argument? (Keep in mind that I don’t have to agree with your arguments, but they do have to take into consideration the theories and evidence that the authors have presented throughout the course.  This means that you can’t make an argument that is directly disproven by the work that we’ve covered in class).  (10 points)</li>
                <li>Did you make conclusions about the new knowledge you’ve acquired? (20 points)</li>

Identify a topic(s) or area(s) of racial and ethnic difference, power, privilege, or discrimination and its impact on contemporary issues. You will be required to critically analyze and unpack a stock and concealed story by surveying a broad audience about the topic your group has chosen. Create a research question about the correlation between concepts in class and its contemporary outcomes. Collect an array of material (i.e. interviews, online resources, pictures, films, etc) to answer that question and compile it in a video. At the end of the video, using at least 3 of frameworks and/or concepts covered in class analyze the responses or data you’ve collected in a fascinating conclusion.</p>

<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    Plagiarism and cheating are bad news. Don’t do it. SFSU as an institution takes academic integrity 
    very seriously, and if you’re caught it can seriously mess up your entire academic career. If you have 
    questions about how to properly credit other peoples’ ideas or words, please email me and we can set 
    up digital office hours to talk about citation or visit the on-campus Writing and Learning Center. 
    Otherwise, plagiarism will result in either a failing grade for the assignment or for the entire course or 
    expulsion, depending on the gravity of the case.
</p>

<h4>Academic Freedom</h4>
<hr>
<p>
    Race and ethnicity has been and continues to be a hotly debated issue, mostly because we all have 
    personal opinions and experiences around issues of race and ethnicity. Still, this is a SOCIOLOGY 
    class—we will be drawing from your experiences and insights—but we will be depending on 
    evidence-based research and sociological scholarship to situate our discussions in larger structural, 
    historical, political and economic forces. We will be examining the social construction of race and 
    ethnicity and sharpening our sociological analysis regarding the issues and problems that surround 
    race and ethnic relations. In designing this course, I have prepared material that describe a range of 
    opinions on the race and ethnicity, however, some of the readings share a perspective that is critical of 
    the mainstream conceptions of race and ethnicity, and this is a perspective that I share as a scholar.
</p>

<p>
    Just as I value my own academic freedom, I also respect and value the freedom of all of my students. 
    I will never discourage anyone from voicing their political beliefs or analysis, so long as it is relevant 
    to the discussion. I encourage people to voice dissenting views (it makes for much livelier 
    discussion!).  I will never censure views that I disagree with, nor will I ever let political beliefs 
    influence my assessment of your work in class.  If anyone feels marginalized or silenced in any way 
    by myself or other students, I hope that you will be able to tell me so that we can resolve the matter.
