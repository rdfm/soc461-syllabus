<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr>
<p>The concepts of race and ethnicity are alive and moving in, both, public and academic discourse. Race and ethnicity are often conceptualized as an American phenomenon in sociological literature. While emerging scholarship postulate that concepts and dynamics of race and ethnicity are and have been a global process.</p>
<p>This course aims to examine and analyze the social processes in which race and ethnicity are globally produced and constructed as “difference.” This course will break open the homogenous and fixed concepts of race and ethnicity, not to deny that there are biological and genetic variations within the human species, rather to analyze the multiple meanings and consequences of these concepts for people in the United States and all over the world. Race and ethnicity, as we will discover, is highly negotiable and subjective, therefore socially constructed. Additionally, this course will address racism, racial inequality and prejudice as core concepts in developing a sociological analysis of race and ethnicity globally.</p>

<h2>Participation</h2>
<hr>
<p>The class needs YOU to be successful! We need to get to know one another so we can dive deep into learning about the complicated topic of race and ethnicity. Weekly, you will be making your social presence known on our online course while also getting to know your classmates. Whether that means you fill out class “yearbook” or responding to a lecture question or commenting on a classmate’s post, this portion of your grade will be about how you contribute positively to our online learning community.</p>

<h2>Weekly Reading Quizzes </h2>
<hr>
<p>Readings for each class is moderate. I have designed the course to get you to read our course material and engage in a quiz or assignment before the weekend starts so you can be free to do your thang. Therefore each student will have to complete an iLearn quiz or an assignment <strong>every Friday by 11:59 PM.</strong>  Quizzes will help you identify key concepts and theories in our readings. Questions for the final examination will be directly gleaned from the weekly quiz. </p>

<h2>Give and Go Assignments</h2>
<hr>
<p>You will have two short papers where you will submit a progress report on your final project and <strong>GIVE</strong> feedback to your classmate. These assignments will propel you and your classmates to <strong>GO</strong> forward with their final projects. The short papers will cover these topics respectively, (1) you will choose a topic regarding global racial and ethnic relations that is occurring in a contemporary social issue, problem, institution or debate, (2) you will identify an organization, social justice movement or group that is combatting the racial inequality in regards of your chosen topic.</p>
<p><strong>The assignments are due on June 19 and 26 on turnitin.com.</strong>All papers MUST be 1 page long and in response to the guidelines provided. They should be formatted with 12-size font in Times New Roman or Arial with one-inch margins and double-spaced. I do not accept late assignments.
</p>
<p>For each short paper, you will be assigned to a classmate so they can <strong>GO</strong> forward with developing their papers towards your final project. You will answer the 3-4 questions to provide feedback to someone’s short paper. These questions can be found on the forum. <strong>Your feedback to your classmate will be due on June 21 and 28, respectively.</strong></p>

<h2>Final Examination</h2>
<hr>
<p>On <strong>July 12</strong>, you will have a timed, open-book final examination that will assess your understanding of concepts and debates that will be covered in readings, videos and lectures for the class. The cumulative examination will have 50 multiple-choice questions that will be directly gleaned from the weekly quiz.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<hr>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are bad news. Don’t do it. SFSU as an institution takes academic integrity very seriously, and if you’re caught it can seriously mess up your entire academic career. If you have questions about how to properly credit other peoples’ ideas or words, please email me and we can set up digital office hours to talk about citation or visit the on-campus Writing and Learning Center. Otherwise, plagiarism will result in either a failing grade for the assignment or for the entire course or expulsion, depending on the gravity of the case.</p>

<h3>Academic Freedom</h3>
<hr>
<p>Race and ethnicity has been and continues to be a hotly debated issue, mostly because we all have personal opinions and experiences around issues of race and ethnicity. Still, this is a SOCIOLOGY class—we will be drawing from your experiences and insights—but we will be depending on evidence-based research and sociological scholarship to situate our discussions in larger structural, historical, political and economic forces. We will be examining the social construction of race and ethnicity and sharpening our sociological analysis regarding the issues and problems that surround race and ethnic relations. In designing this course, I have prepared material that describe a range of opinions on the race and ethnicity, however, some of the readings share a perspective that is critical of the mainstream conceptions of race and ethnicity, and this is a perspective that I share as a scholar.</p>
<p>Just as I value my own academic freedom, I also respect and value the freedom of all of my students. I will never discourage anyone from voicing their political beliefs or analysis, so long as it is relevant to the discussion. I encourage people to voice dissenting views (it makes for much livelier discussion!).  I will never censure views that I disagree with, nor will I ever let political beliefs influence my assessment of your work in class.  If anyone feels marginalized or silenced in any way by myself or other students, I hope that you will be able to tell me so that we can resolve the matter.</p>
